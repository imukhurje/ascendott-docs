## Setting up

Get your **Over The Top (OTT)** site up and running in just days. 

You can get the website up in 1-5 days depending upon how much content you have to upload initially. 

The smartphone and TV apps - if you have subscribed for them - should be ready within 4 business days after the firm Statement Of Work (SOW) is received. But, getting the apps into Google Play Store and Apple App Store can take upto 3 weeks (or more) and we can do very little about it.
