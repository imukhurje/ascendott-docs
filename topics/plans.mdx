<Accordion title="Top-Up" icon="tv">

A **Top-Up** is an add-on feature that works **in combination with an active SVOD plan**.  
It gives access to special content for a limited time, but its validity is always tied to the subscription.

**How It Works:**

- You must have an **active subscription plan (SVOD)** to purchase and use a top-up.
- If a content requires a **10-day top-up**, you need to buy that top-up to access it.
- If your subscription **expires before the top-up validity**, the top-up will also end.
  - Example: Subscription expires in 5 days → 10-day top-up will only work for 5 days.
- Top-ups cannot be used without an active SVOD subscription.

**Key Features:**

- **Subscription-Dependent** — Always linked to an active SVOD plan.
- **Content-Specific** — Unlocks exclusive or premium content.
- **Limited Duration** — Works only within the subscription’s validity period.
- **Monetization Flexibility** — Allows charging extra for premium content inside SVOD.
