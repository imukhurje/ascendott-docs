### Tips
- Large files: keep the browser tab open until the upload finishes.
- Recommended formats: MP4 (H.264/AAC) for widest compatibility; AV1/H.265 if your audience devices support them.
- If you see “CORS” or “Forbidden” errors during upload, verify the admin domain and API base URL for your tenant.
