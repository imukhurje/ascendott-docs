## Get started in three steps

Get your OTT site running make your first customization.

### Step 1: We configure our software for your use

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Send Statement Of Work (SOW)">
    Based on our final quote, you need to send us a SOW (if you are unfamiliar with an SOW, our support team will help you draw one out).
    You should also send us your logo in a high resolution, e.g. 1000x600 or something near.
    If you have already purchased a domain to use for your OTT, you need to point it to an IP we will provide you in our acknowledgement email for the SOW (if you are unfamiliar with setting up DNS records, our support staff will help).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Get your admin credentials from us">
    During the onboarding process, we will send you your Admin credentials along with the URL for your admin panel within 24 hours of us receiving the SOW
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Sign in using your credentials.">
    You need to visit the admin panel url we sent you above, enter your credentials and sign in.
    You will be sent an OTP to your registered email box.
    Use the OTP in the next screen and you should be able to access the Admin panel for your White Branded OTT site.
  </Accordion>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.
