### Step 1: Sign legal documents

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Exchange legal documents - SOW and SLSLA">
    1. You prepare a Statement Of Work (SOW) - do not worry, we can share a template that you can modify after discussing with our support team.
    2. We send you a Software Licensing and Service Level Agreement template that you can modify after discussing with our support team.
    3. Legal representatives on your side and our side sign the two above documents and exchange the signed copies. The signing can be digital.

</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Gain access to your Admin portal and set things up

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Log into your Admin Portal">
    1. Immediately after the documents are signed, you will receive an email in your mailbox with your admin portal url and credentials.
    2. Use that info to log into your admin portal for the first time. Note that you will need to be prepared to access and use an One Time Password which is sent to the email id you registered with us.
    3. On your first login you will also be prompted to change the temporary password our support team will have set up for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Change the Settings and Save Changes">
    Within the Admin Portal, navigate to the Settings menu item on the left panel and set things up - do not worry, if you do not understandsome of the stuff there, our support team representative will help you set these up.

    1. Upload your logo.
    2. Enter credentials for the outbound emails sender - used mainly for sending information/OTP to your users.
    3. If you want to integrate SMS provider of your choice, you need to put in the credentials. If you opted for our SMS service, you need not bother about this.
    4. Change the theme of your user facing OTT website.
    5. Save your changes. It may take a little while - up to 10 minutes, for the changes to take effect.

    **At this point you can go to your public facing OTT URL and see a blank site with just your logo and some essential buttons like Login and Subscribe. This shows your OTT website is now up and running!**

  </Accordion>

### Step 3: Upload your content and Go live!

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your content and show them on the OTT frontend">
  1. Go to the Content section from the left menu and start uploading and defining your videos with SEO friendly titles and descriptions, display images for the front end, etc.
  2. Once you are satisfied with how your content looks, hit publish for each uploaded video.
  3. Although you have published the videos, they are not visible on the OTT site yet. You need to decorate your home page with components like Carousels, Trays, Banners, HTML snippets etc and save. For this you need to go to our Template Editor.
